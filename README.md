# Skadoop Bop (hello!)
- Beep boop. I am NT_Miles AKA NT_Scor. I am proudly working on Discord bot development for YOU, the user, to get a jump start on!
# Bap! (currently work in progress)
- Scorbunny/Raboot/Cinderace: The first actual pokémon bot (not quick help) that is open source!
- Pikachu: the aid to Scorbunny/Raboot/Cinderace in listing/identification. this'll be the first bot to use the **`CinderScor API IIE`**!
- Zacian: Extensions on each pre-coded-bot base.
